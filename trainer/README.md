## Install

Clone this repo and execute in your favourite shell:

* `npm i -g gulp` to install gulp globally (if you don't have it installed already)
* `npm install` to install local npm dependencies

> While npm intall should also install the typings, at times this does not happen. Install typing with command `npm typings install`

## Play

After completing installation type in your favourite shell:

* `gulp play` to start the app in a new browser window. App files are observed and will be re-transpiled on each change.
